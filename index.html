        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! My name is Eleanor Min and I am currently a student.<br><br>

        I attend the beautiful campus of the University of California, Riverside. I live on campus since I am a first year in college, which is extremely convenient. I get to walk to class in less than twenty minutes and I do not have to worry about parking. Parking on this campus is extremely difficult due to the limited space that is provided. 
<br><br>In my free time I like to paint my nails. It is therapeutic. The preparation to paint nails is my favorite part. I remove my old nail polish in acetone. Then I soak the nails in warm water to soften the cuticles. The nails get dried with a towel and I apply castor oil to further soften my nails. I get a nail cuticle pusher that removes the dead cells from the top layer of my nails and push the cuticles further back. The cuticle is then trimmed since the excess skin gets in the way of the presentation of the nail. This process is slow and delicate since we are cutting off skin; oftentimes it is easy to knick yourself. After the skin is removed, I wash my hands with soap and water to get rid of all the excess oil before I apply the paint. I apply the base coat on my nails to prevent my nails from getting stained with my color of choice. The color of choice is then applied, usually two to three layers of it. I wait for each coat to dry about 10 minutes before I move on to the next layer. Then I apply the famous fast drying top, Seche Vite. This dries in seconds and truly is the best topcoat that ever existed. 
<br><br>I also like to take care of my body. I make an effort to go to the gym. I go with my friends who know how to lift and they coach me. I ask for the fundamentals of gyming and form. I take form very seriously since I want to be doing my exercises correctly and one day be independent from their coaching. I want to take my health as a priority so I try to stick to a mostly lean diet of vegetables and lean meats. I try to eat foods like spinach, grilled chicken breast, legumes, onions, tomatoes, and fruit. 
<br><br>I also enjoy hanging out with my family. I try to go back home every other week. When I am back, I try to meet all of my immediate family and make a meal together. There is plenty of time to talk about what is going on in our lives when we are preparing the food and then eating it and then putting it away. Family gatherings are centered around a meal because everyone is in the same place at once. Dinners usually last for an hour and a half because there is so much to discuss. 
<br><br>Oh and I am taking Introduction to Computer Science!
